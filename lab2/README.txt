For testing the add efficiency, adding to the front took nearly twenty minutes, while adding to the back took only 5. I would assume that this is most likely due to the fact that if you add an element to the front of a list, you need to shift every single element to the left, whereas adding to the back of a list requires no shifting.

For some reason, my testMemory runs in .0009 seconds, and I can’t find out why. Also, it doesn’t print anything.
